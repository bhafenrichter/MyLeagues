# MyLeagues

## The Problem
For much of my college life, my friends and I loved to spend our leisure time after class playing causal sports games such as Madden or 2K.  We had a ton of fun playing these games, but being a competitor as well, we had no way of authentically tracking who really was the best at each game.  It raised many light-hearted debates.  It also built up a surprisingly strong, and at the time thriving community as communication regarding the subject would be strictly over group texts.  This led me to come up with the idea of addressing both of these problems with one app.

## The Solution
MyLeagues.  This React Native cross-platform app was designed to fix this issue.  Using Facebook and Google Firebase in the backend, I constructed an app that track:

1. Scores
2. Records
3. Leaderboards

Each user would login to the app via Facebook API, and create a league for the game they wanted to keep track of.  In this case, this would be Madden, 2K, FIFA, ect.  Once the league was created, they would add their friends who also had the app to the league.  When the league was assembled, they could go on playing as normal.  After they completed a game, they could submit the game to the app and the user's record would be recorded and saved for later.  Over time, you would obviously get a very good idea of who truly was the best.  But, it would also facilitate a community for these kinds of activities.

## Technical Details
MyLeagues takes advantages of the following technologies:

1. React Native
2. Google Firebase
3. Facebook Users
4. Various React Libraries
